OnPay (https://onpay.com) built the best online payroll service by combining 30 years of experience as a payroll provider with the latest technology.

This module aims to connect Odoo with OnPay to run payroll.
As of today, OnPay API does not support sending input data for payroll run.
So we decided to generate a csv file for you to export timesheets and expenses
out of Odoo and import it (without opening it) into OnPay.
