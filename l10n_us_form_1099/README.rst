============
US Form 1099
============

When companies hire others as contractors, the contractor in question may
work for themselves, another company or be the whole other company. This
is a huge range, but it can be simplified down to "do I report their
payment to the IRS as a 1099?".

This module extends the functionality of a partner and allow you to specify 1099 suppliers.

You will still need to manage payment and IRS reporting separately.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

#. Go to Contacts
#. Create or select a partner
#. Go to the Sales & Purchases tab
#. Check the "Is a 1099" box
