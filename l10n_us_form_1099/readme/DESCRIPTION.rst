When companies hire others as contractors, the contractor in question may
work for themselves, another company or be the whole other company. This
is a huge range, but it can be simplified down to "do I report their
payment to the IRS as a 1099?".

This module extends the functionality of a partner and allows you to specify
1099 suppliers, their 1099 type and their 1099-MISC box.

It also provide a report of payments by types and boxes in Accounting > Reporting > 1099 Report.

You will still need to manage payment and IRS reporting separately.
